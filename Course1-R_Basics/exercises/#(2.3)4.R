#In math and programming, we say that we evaluate a function when we replace the argument with a given number. So if we type 1  sqrt(4), 
#we evaluate the sqrt function. In R, you can evaluate a function inside another function. 
#The evaluations happen from the inside out. Use one 2  line of code to compute the log, in base 10, of the square root  of 100.

sol <- log(sqrt(100), 10)
sol
